        ASYNCHROUNOUS - Tasks can be started and then allowed to complete at a later time, without waiting for the previous task to finish. This is useful when some operations might take time.

        SYNCHROUNOUS - Tasks are executed one at a time in a sequential manner. Each task must finish before the next one starts.

        SINGLE THREADED - Tasks are executed one after another. If one task is slow or blocked (e.g., waiting for I/O), the entire program waits until the task finishes.

        MULTIPLE THREADED - Tasks are executed concurrently. One thread can handle a time-consuming task while others perform different tasks, improving performance.

        Execution Context - Execute one line of code at a time. Each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing.

        Blocking Code Vs Non Blocking code
        Blocking Code - Block the flow of program. Read file sync
        Non Blocking Code - Doesn't Block execution. Read file async
